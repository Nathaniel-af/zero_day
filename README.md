Vagrant is an open-source software tool for building and managing virtual development environments. It allows developers to easily set up, configure, and manage virtual machines for their projects, eliminating the need for manual configuration and reducing the time it takes to get started on a project. Vagrant uses virtualization technology, such as VirtualBox, to create isolated virtual environments that are fully reproducible and can be shared with others.
